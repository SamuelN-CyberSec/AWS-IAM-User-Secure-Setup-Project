# AWS-IAM-User-Secure-Setup-Project
This project demonstrates the secure creation and configuration of an IAM user in AWS, following industry best practices. It covers permission assignment using AWS-managed job function policies and the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to enhance account security. 

## Objective
-IAM user creation  
-permission Assignment 
-multifactor Authentication (MFA) Configuration
-Multifactor Authentication Verification

**###Technology and service used** 
- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- AWS Managed Policies 
- Virtual MFA Application (Microsoft Authenticator)

**##Steps**
-IAM user creation 
-logged in to AWS management console as the root user 
-Attached AWS Managed job function policies to the Iam user for secure role-specific access
-Enabled MFA for the IAM user
-chose virtual device option 
-Scanned the provided QR code using Microsoft  authenticator
-Completed MFA setup by imputing the two consecutive code generated by APP
-Logged in as IAM user to verify MFA enforcement 
-Successfully entered the time-based one-time password (TOTP) to complete login Authentication


**##Key Best Practiced Followed**
-Avoided using the root account for daily operation
-Enforced multifactor authentication for enhanced account security 
-Applied least privilege access principle by assigning only necessary managed service
-verified IAM configuration through practical sign-in testing
